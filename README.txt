When debugging coders usually can get stuck on a bug and because of frustration and stress coders can find themself debugging the bug less efficientl, thats where our idea comes handy. 

Currently:
1. Coders will have this website open while coding
2. Play the calming audio to have calming experience while coding and dealing with debugging.
3. When stuck in a bug, coders can come back to Coditate and follow the steps of debugging 

Check out Coditate here: (link)[https://rustamova00.github.io/coditate.github.io/]

Future:
The website will allow automatically sense the pause in coding and alert the coder in set time to meditate to decrease stress and increase productivity.
